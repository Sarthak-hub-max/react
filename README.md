🧠 Project Title: Typing Test App
📝 Description

The Typing Test App is a responsive web application built using React and JavaScript that helps users measure their typing speed and accuracy in real time. The app provides a random text prompt for users to type within a fixed time limit and calculates Words Per Minute (WPM) and Accuracy Percentage instantly after the test ends.

It offers a smooth and minimal user interface powered by Bootstrap, with live stats display, automatic timer activation, and a restart option for retaking the test.

💡 How It Works

The app displays a random text prompt.

When the user starts typing, the timer begins counting down from 60 seconds.

The app tracks each character typed and calculates:

WPM: Based on total words typed and time elapsed.

Accuracy: Based on correct vs. incorrect characters.

Once time runs out, results are displayed with an option to restart.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add dark/light mode toggle.

Include difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard).

Store best scores using localStorage.

Add real-time character highlighting (correct/incorrect).

Display a progress bar for remaining time.
